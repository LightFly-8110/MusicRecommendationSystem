# MusicRecommendationSystem
A music recommendation system uses facial emotion recognition to suggest personalized songs. OpenCV and Deepface libraries detect facial expressions and extract emotions. A small music library in MySQL recommends a song based on the user's preferred language. The user is redirected to the browser for the recommended song.
